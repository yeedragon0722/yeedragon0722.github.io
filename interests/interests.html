            <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
            <p>I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges and participating in competitive programming contests. It's a great way to sharpen problem-solving skills and think under pressure. I was in the team "Miku Fan Club" for ICPC NCNA 2023, and won third place in the contest.</p>

            <h3>Badminton</h3>
            <p>Playing badminton helps me stay active and focused. I was in my school's badminton club when I was in elementary school!</p>

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p>I love experimenting in the kitchen, whether it's trying out new recipes or putting a twist on old ones. Cooking is both a creative outlet and a way to relax after a long day for me, especially since I can eat yummy food afterwards!</p>
